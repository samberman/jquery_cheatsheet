			<p>Sample so I can dismantle your cranium. best taste is bottlin' milk. Flexin' the futuristic style. You know I gotta handle my sponsatility. gregarious with verbals for your merriment. the model of filth. Cause I'm getting foul when I'm meddled with. blow you like the deathstar. like a grain of sand. you better aqueous. About me?. yo whattup del-phonic?. while you chokin' you're eye's are open. Rhyme flow. add a twist to my manuscripts</p>

			<p>rhyme and reason mixed with violent feelin's. I settle this. i'm like, "man - dude you just a offspring". i'm shooting then executing you're aiming from mainstream. and I aint jokin'. Del - Yo, I got you tight as what, you got me?. Did you forget. That I was even alive?. recucitate. So meditate. i'm very interplanetary and vary with various experiments. That will devistate minds. Hop-a-long to the song that is strong. We were once so strong. Everything we ever had?</p>

				<p>Now bust a style.. of the few and the proud that are crowding around the canals. /beta. private wars and a chore to relate in a world that you made fulla minor chords. Face to the sun but there's fumes in the view.. And everything is so beautiful.. Off in the Deep. Born of a bad creation.. It's like you had to pull the rug from underneath yourself to feel alive. (Shit) They got you fired up.. Humans consumed in what's holding em' down,. Civilians still feel isolated.. Gutter baller stutter strut, fuck is up.Alkaline dumping out.</p>

				<p>And it's hard to hold it steady when half your friends are dead already. You cried when they asked you to leave,. Remember the sessions.. And it's hard to keep trying when half your friends are dying. With the lambs from my dreams looking up at your hands.. And your hands pointing up at the lights.. Well they scratched at my shoulder and they ripped at my shirt.. I went back inside and was seen by some nurse.. in the park drinking dark bacardi. thinking things are funny when they really ain't that funny. the kids on the corner they keep getting stung. the color of our teeth matches the color of our tongues. in the back bay fens getting gentle. up against the fence with some guy who looks like mickey mantle. dirty minds keep coming thru the mud. the color of their eyes matches the color of our blood.. How we made a connection.. U.S. ingenuity, Canadian Security,. a knockoff necktie. the way he wore it made it look more like a tourniquet. i looked deep in his eyes i saw lynn, massachussetts. she hung a sleeveless dress up on a sleeved up lifestyle. girl you gotta cover that. he was gushing blood from wide open wounds and she decided that she loved him. they put the screws into charlemagne. he had a detox dream he saw christ in all his glory. charlemagne didn't feel any pain. but he's bleeding from the holes in his story. he said: hey my name is corey. i'm really into hardcore. people call me hard corey. don't you hate these clever people and all these clever people parties.. I saw you coming at me,. You put your nails in my neck,. They showed up in the dressing room and pretty much surrounded me.</p>

				<p>British Amplifiers, Point to Point technology.. Didn't seem like you were coming in peace.. If I'm getting through to you.. We got taxmen coming around the back in their kevlar vests. It's hard to get ahead when half your friends are dead. Militia men cooking up a batch of the crystal meth. People keep calling me Right Said Fred. The bus it rolled up into Franklin at dawn and everything seemed super slo-mo.. I'm sure you get terrified too.. But people keep calling me Drop Dead Fred. Sat in the back of the theater just drinking and talking. The Waffle House waitress that asked us if we were Pink Floyd.. the call came in on a princess phone on the patio. she said: hey if that's jeppetto tell him i'm not here yet. tell him that i ain't done with my beers yet. tell him that i'm up in massachussetts. if he wants to buy me some i'll be in the kitchenette. making meals out of marzipan. making love with the black and tans. crushing butts in a coffee can. when the crowd went wild. we were under the stands. mouths and hands. hands and mouths. so many shows where nobody comes out.. I just wanna be, untouchable.. I've been trying to get people to call me Freddie Mercury</p>
